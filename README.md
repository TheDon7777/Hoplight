# Hoplight
AI-assisted Security Operations Platform prototype with real-time SOC, analytics, investigation, detection/response, governance, and reporting, with privacy-by-design and PII redaction.

**Hoplight** is a prototype security operations platform I designed and built to explore how **AI-powered analytics** can enhance SOC workflows.  
It integrates traditional SIEM functions with AI-driven correlation, investigation, and reporting â€” all with **privacy-by-design controls** like PII redaction before AI processing.

## Key Features

### Real-Time SOC Suite
- Group-level security overview (endpoints, signals, alerts)  
- AI-driven **threat clustering** and correlation  
- **Risk escalation engine** tracking repeat and evolving threats  

### Advanced Analytics Suite
- In-depth threat analytics with historical context  
- Endpoint **behavioral baselines** per group  
- **Pattern engine** to detect deviations from expected activity  

### Investigation Suite
- **Forensic analysis workflows** using AI + correlation  
- **MITRE ATT&CK chain reconstruction** and kill chain mapping  
- **Threat intelligence**: IOC matching, campaign linkage  

### Detection & Response Suite
- **Correlation engine** for multi-source signals  
- **Enhanced AI triage** to reduce false positives  
- Incident response metrics: MTTR, SLA compliance, analyst logs  

### Governance & Compliance Suite
- Custom dashboards for **PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, or client frameworks**  
- AI-generated **executive summaries** (daily/weekly/monthly) with graphs & KPIs  
- Technical report exports for SOCs and MSP analysts  

### Audit & Baselines
- Per-group baseline definitions and deviation tracking  
- Full audit logs for compliance and forensic readiness

## Security & Privacy
- **Privacy by design**: PII scrubbed before AI sees data  
- **TLS-encrypted traffic**, **SSH keys-only**, secrets managed via `.env`  
- **MongoDB hardening**: role-based access, SCRAM-SHA-256 auth, TLS in transit  
- Audit logging for all privileged actions

## Architecture Overview
**Stack:**  
- Backend: **Node.js & Wazuh** (129 APIs across 13 modules)  
- Database: **MongoDB** (schemas + baselines + audit logs)  
- Frontend: **JavaScript** dashboard (work in progress)  
- AI Integration: PII redaction â†’ AI analysis â†’ reporting pipeline  

**Deployment:**  
- Hosted on hardened VPS (Ubuntu)  
- TLS, SSH keys-only, firewall rules (80/443 only)
